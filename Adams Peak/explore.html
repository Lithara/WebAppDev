                    <p>The holy mountain has been popularly known as "Sri Pada" since asncient times. 
                        "Sri Pada" is also known as "Samanala Kanda" (Butterfly Mountain) due to the 
                        swarms of butterflies that surround the sides of the mountain at the beginning 
                        of the season. According to ancient beliefs, God Suman Saman is the Protector 
                        of Sri Pada; thus, it is also known as "Samanta-Kuta." "Adams Peak," "Rathnagiri", 
                        and "Swargarohanam" are a few names used for Sri Pada.</p>
    
                        <p>The pilgrimage season traditionally starts on the full moon in December and 
                            ends on the full moon in May. The season and off-season are mainly determined 
                            by the rain. The season starts in the middle of the North Eastern Monsoon, 
                            where this region receives significantly low rainfall, and ends in May, the 
                            month in which the South Eastern Monsoon starts. During the off-season months, 
                            Peak Wilderness receives a heavy rainfall, and it was difficult and risky to 
                            attempt the hike during the off-season in the past, but with recent developments 
                            and new technology available, hikers frequently complete off-season hikes now.</p>
                        
                        <p>There are many traditional customs bound to the climbing of Sri Pada Mountain. 
                            The first-time climber of Sri Pada is known as "Kodukarayo". There are three 
                            types of Kodukarayo. Child first-timers are called "Kirikodu" while the 
                            youngsters are called "Nambarakodu" and the adults are called "Dandukodu". 
                            It is customary for devotees to bathe at the stream called "Seetha Gangula" 
                            and dress in white clothes before starting the journey.</p>

                    <p>"Indikatupana" is the place where devotees stop and hang a threaded needle from 
                        a shrub. It is said that when the Buddha came to Sri Lanka, he sewed his robe 
                        there. People are still collecting needles and threads and dumping them on tree 
                        branches, bushes, and everywhere else in the area to celebrate that action. 
                        Pilgrims can see the threads as if they were a large spider net. The rock from 
                        which the Buddha swung his robe became known as "gettampana”.</p>
    
                    <p>Devotees usually sing various folk songs while climbing the mountain. At the 
                        summit, they ring the bell according to the number of visits to Sri Pada. 
                        The main goal of the Sri Pada devotees is to reach the peak of the mountain 
                        before the sun rises. This gory view of the sun rising is called "Ira sewaya," 
                        which makes for an unforgettable experience.</p>
    
                    <p>The words used during the Sri Pada pilgrimage are owed a special place in our 
                        culture. 'Nadaya', 'Nade Gura', 'Kodu', 'Kirikodu', 'Hime', 'Karunavai', 'Peweema', 
                        'Kata varadda ganeema', 'Kode', 'Ambalama', and 'Padhmaya' are among them. Sri Pada 
                        devotees who climb up and climb down wish each other to have the blessing of 
                        God Sumana.</p>
    
                    <p>"Lihinihela" is a popular place on the way to Adams Peak. It is a huge precipice, 
                        like the world’s end. Behind the valley, a large mountain can be seen. There, 
                        the pilgrims yell "Lihini Akke." The echo of their yelling can then be heard 
                        by them. There is a sorrowful folk story behind this shouting. In Sinhalese 
                        "hela" means the precipice. "Lihinihela" is the home of a woman named "Lihini."</p>
    
                    <p>In accordance with folklore, Lihinihela didn't have a valley in the very distant 
                        past. There was a small hut, and there lived a mother and her baby in it. One 
                        day it began to rain. So Mother came out of the hut to collect clothes. At that 
                        time, the earth went down and made this valley. Hut vanished. "Lihini Akka," 
                        the mother and her baby, were berried alive. People believe that the spirit of 
                        "Lihini Akka" is still in the valley, and this spirit is looking for her baby. 
                        So people say that the echo is the voice of "Lihini Akka."</p>
